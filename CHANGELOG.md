# Changelog

## 0.3.0 - 2025-08-31

Various performance-related improvements.

### Changed

* !Store filter coeffs and taps in opposite order (most-recent-last) to improve vectorization
* !Const-unroll compute intensive loops
    * !Limit size of FIR filters to <128 taps
    * !Limit order of polynomial fractional delay filters to <=10
* Add `u` value as initial for A*x dot product
    * (Potentially substantially) Improves float error for small values of latest measurement
      `u` at the expense of slightly worse float error for large `u`
* Update flop per eval count to 4N-1
* Update rust edition to 2024

## 0.2.5 - 2025-05-25

### Changed

* Make `Ring` and `AlignedArray` pub to support read-only access to filter internals

### Added

* Add FIR module with generic number field type
* Add Lagrange interpolator fractional delay filter construction
* Add functions for read-only access to IIR filter internals

## 0.2.4 - 2025-02-06

### Changed

* Change large const arrays to static to avoid inlining excessively large data

## 0.2.3 - 2025-01-01

### Changed

* Use ring buffer for IIR and median filter state storage
* Lower align of SisoIirFilter struct, since the internal storage is already aligned

### Added

* Implement N-point median filter for odd N >= 3

## 0.2.2 - 2024-12-27

### Changed

* Derive Clone and Copy on `SisoIirFilter` to allow faster construction of batches of identical filters
* Make `generated` module pub to provide access to min/max cutoff ratio bounds for generated filters
* Loosen version requirement on num_traits dep

## 0.2.1 - 2024-12-26

### Changed

* Lower align of `SisoIirFilter` struct and internal state arrays to 8

### Added

* Add `SisoIirFilter.initialize(u)` to set the internal state vector to the steady-state values associated with a given measurement `u`

## 0.2.0 - 2024-07-10

### Changed

* Implement rescaling of `C` vector during initialization of interpolated filters to correct gain for interpolation error
* Tighten tolerance on gain of generated butterworth filters to 0.01% at minimum cutoff ratio
* Decrease range of validity for generated butterworth filters

## 0.1.0 - 2024-04-07

### Added

* Initial release
